### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

As this is my first project ,I learned a lot about design .
As I was never good at design even knowing most of the css properties used in a design i could do it it on my own.
This helped me to implement the styles to complete a project.
